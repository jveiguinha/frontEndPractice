                <h2>We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.</h2>
                <p class="mainParagraphs">Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.</p>

                <p class="mainParagraphs">Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their magic and grow. We&#39;ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don&#39;t always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

In addition, staff-organized development and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.</p>

                <p class="mainParagraphs">If you&#39;re joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork. We&#39;ll even provide you with free German or English lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it&#39;s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.</p>
